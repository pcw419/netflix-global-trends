## Overview

This project explores the global evolution of Netflix within the rapidly expanding OTT (Over-the-Top) streaming market.  
Through a series of visual and statistical analyses, we examined how Netflix has grown internationally and adapted to changing audience preferences, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.  
The visualizations were primarily built using a Kaggle dataset on OTT video streaming platforms (revenue and users), supplemented with external market reports for context.

## Objectives

- Analyze Netflix’s position and growth within the OTT market  
- Investigate changes in content type, production country, and genre composition  
- Visualize financial trends such as net income and content spending  
- Examine viewer preferences and runtime trends over time   

---

## Key Findings

- The global OTT market is expected to reach **$1.24 trillion by 2030** (Precedence Research).  
- Netflix’s net income dramatically increased during 2020–2021, reflecting pandemic-driven demand.  
- The United States dominates content production, but non-English originals such as *Squid Game* achieved global success.  
- Average runtime has decreased over the decades, showing a user preference for shorter, more efficient content.  
- The top 20 most viewed titles include diverse genres—action, comedy, crime, and drama remain dominant.   

---

## Insights and Suggestions

- Focus on content quality rather than relying solely on popular cast members.  
- Increase investment in non-English and international productions to attract broader audiences.  
- Encourage genre diversity to maintain long-term user engagement.

## Conclusion

Netflix continues to dominate the OTT market due to its vast content library and global influence.  
However, the rise of non-English content and regional storytelling signals an evolving future for streaming entertainment.  
Maintaining a balance between quality, diversity, and innovation will be crucial for sustaining Netflix’s global growth.
